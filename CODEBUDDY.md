## Project Overview

**learning-transformers** — A hands-on project for learning the Transformer architecture by implementing it from scratch.

## Architecture

This repository is in its early stages. The goal is to learn and implement Transformer models by hand. As the codebase grows, this section should be updated to reflect the module structure and how components (e.g., attention mechanisms, positional encodings, encoder/decoder layers) relate to each other.
